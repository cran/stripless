Changes in stripless 1.0-2
===========================

  * Some bug fixes, especially in handling a ‘groups’ argument to the strucplot()
    call. A ‘groups = NULL’ argument specification has been added to strucplot()
    as part of the fix.


  * A package vignette has been added.


  * Changed the 'spacings' argument to strucplot() to allow either a single vector
    or a list with a single component, in which case it is replicated for the
    other direction. Also non-integer values now are documented to work(they
    worked before but were not documented to do so).


  * The 'abbrevLength' argument to print() methods and defaultStrucLegend()
    has been extended to allow control of both factor names and levels.


  * print.structured() and defaultStrucLegend() have gained optional 'lbl' and
    'legendLab'arguments, respectively, to allow users to change or omit "Plot
    Structure" legend titles. Both share new 'heading' and 'miss' arguments for
    further user customization.
